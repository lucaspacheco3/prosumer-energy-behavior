**Exploratory Data Analysis of Prosumer Energy Behavior**

The data are from the 'Enefit' kaggle competiton, which has timeseries data about electricity usage and production patterns from Estonian energy customers with solar panels installed.
The EDA merges the various data sources including client information and weather data, then uses plots to find important patterns in the data. 
Plotting electricity consumption or production against various time series features allows us to better understand the seasonal nature of energy usage and will enable us to build better predictive models.
